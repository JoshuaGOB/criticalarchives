Ticha means language in Zapotec, an indigenous language spoken in Southern Mexico. Ticha is a digital platform that was and is being created by an interdisciplinary team of scholars from different fields in the United States and Mexico at Haverford College Libraries: Brook D. Lillehaugen, George A. Broadwell, Michel R. Oudijk, and Laurie Allen. The corpus presented is from the colonial period and focuses on three main works; all of these texts come from the geographic region of Central Valley Zapotec Oaxaca. The first one is *[Arte]*, a book published in 1578 by Juan de Cordova, a Spanish priest in the Dominican order. The second is *Doctrina christiana en lengua castellana y çapoteca* by Dominican priest Pedro de Feria. The third set of materials presented are handwritten texts mainly written by nativeZapotec speakers in Zapotec and some in Spanish about religious issues, testaments, wills, deeds, and letters. The digital platform is organized in three main categories: [About](https://ticha.haverford.edu/en/about/), [Colonial Zapotec](https://ticha.haverford.edu/en/context/), [Explore the texts](https://ds-omeka.haverford.edu/ticha/en/texts.html). In addition to this information, at the bottom of [the about page](https://ticha.haverford.edu/en/about/), one can find videos about the project with the team. This opportunity allows users to understand the motivation and processes of the project. It is important to also note that the project has been led by a team of linguists and anthropologists, therefore it's not surprising that Ticha encodes the data in the following two ways: FLEx which is Fieldworks Language 
Explorer, a system for lexical and grammatical analysis, and Text Encoding Initiative standards for paleographic 
and translational representations of texts, as stated in About the Project. 

Ticha is an innovative and interactive contemporary digital platform that brings awareness to the users. Each of the sections contextualize the project and explore the texts, providing a wide range of materials. For instance, *Arte en lengua zapoteca*, has an outline, a PDF version of the text, and a sample page that includes: original text, transcription of the text, modern Spanish and English, and the original transcription of the text and a version in modern day Spanish. *Doctrina christiana en lengua castellana* includes a PDF version of the text and a sample page with: the original text, a transcription and a linguistic analysis. Finally, there are a total of fifty handwritten manuscripts, twenty one found in Spanish and twenty-nine in Zapotec, all organized by name, year, town, archive, type of document and language, original text, and a transcription. There is a sample manuscript that includes the original page images in Zapotec and Spanish, as well as transcriptions in Zapotec and Spanish with the following metadata: archive name, collection, call number, pages, year, date, primary parties, witnesses, and scribe. Overall, each category provides open access to explore the material and interact with images of the original documents, transcriptions, translations to English and Spanish, download the texts, and be able to provide comments, suggestions to the team.

Ticha is primarily targeted for an academic audience in fields not limited to history, anthropology, linguistics, cultural studies and anyone who is interested in colonial Zapotec. This platform was also created for the one and half million Zapotec speakers in Mexico and the United States, in cities like Los Angeles. For instance, in one of the videos, Janet Chávez Santiago, a Zapotec teacher from Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca stated the engagement and excitement from her students when comparing modern Zapotec to colonial Zapotec. The interest from her students is vast especially when many believed these corpuses of materials to be abroad, out of access. Scholars Carlos Aguirre and Javier Villa-Flores state how the archive legitimizes forms of authority and credibility; thus, in thinking with Ticha it is important to reflect on who has access and how it can and should be used as a political platform with active and dynamic elements (12). 

To further address the question of accessibility, technology plays an important role in supporting a community. As Lara Putnam states, “the impact of digitization on the knowability of past processes of whatever scale and locale is significant” (380). Ticha in this particular case, is serving a community that is actively working with the language, not only academics, but the Zapotec community. The interactive, feasible, self-explanatory access Ticha provides is changing the ways archives have been perceived to be. This is particularly seen with the implementation of audio recording from current community members of the 600 words found in the dictionary, a feature that is still in progress. Through the work shown in Ticha, one of their main goals is to extend bridges and render visible voices from the past, present and future to acknowledge a community that has been silenced. Therefore, as the digital archive develops and expands, how will Ticha continue to serve different audiences, reflect several voices in the archive, and continue to emphasize a sense of reciprocity with the Zapotec community?
