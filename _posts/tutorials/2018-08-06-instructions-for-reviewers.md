Every Critical Archive Review will undergo peer-review prior to publication. This process is designed to replicate the editorial process of an academic publication.

As a peer-reviewer, your job is to ensure that the article is ready to be seen by a public audience. This involves two things:
1. Reviewing for content: does the article meet the expectations of the assignment? Is it clear and easy to read? Does the structure make sense.
2. Copyediting: Does the review have significant grammatical or spelling errors? Does it display properly in markdown?

To provide content-level review, complete [the peer review form](../../pdf/peerReviewForm.docx) and send it to the author.

For copyediting, you'll be using the GitHub platform. Follow the instructions below.
